## Project starter
A base template with nothing more than Bootstrap (Sass) & Underscore.js

Gulp is used to run tasks and there's a small server that'll run your project on localhost:9000 using Connect and LiveReload.

To get started, just run these commands:

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ bower install`
3. `$ gulp`
