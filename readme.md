## React.js project starter
Branched version of the plain project starter that'll give you a quick starting point for React.js apps

To get started, just run these commands:

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ bower install`
3. `$ gulp`

Then head to `coffee/app-bootstrap.cjsx` to set up some routes and add your views, pages and components to the *coffee/components* folder.
